    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The week&rsquo;s topics included Test-Driven Development, Databases, and SQL. Within our pairs, we created a Blackjack Engine which mimicked thousands of blackjack games based on different strategies. Next, we got into databases; specifically, the International Movie Database (IMDB). I learned why we should use them, some examples of databases that I was already familiar with (e.g. an Excel spreadsheet or my iPhone contacts), and how to extract actual data from them using SQL. The next project was to build our own SimpleRecord within pairs. Using Ruby and SQL, we interacted with IMDB to query a SQLite database containing IMDB data.</p>

<p>We ended the week by doing a Teach to Learn exercise in groups of seven. The topics: classes versus instances, class methods versus instance methods, inheritance &amp; the method lookup chain, classes versus modules, instance attributes, and arrays versus hashes. Within the groups, each person presented what he or she knew about the given topics. Though this was a simple exercise, it helped me so much. It was awesome to hear different ways of thinking about things; I was able to understand these concepts better by hearing things repeated again and again.</p>

<p>My time at Fullstack thus far has been <em>unusual</em>. For the first time in my 13-year career as a student am I being challenged beyond what I&rsquo;d think to be a regular challenge. But that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here, to learn something new, something previously foreign to me. Though I find myself a little frustrated at times, it&rsquo;s a good kind of frustrated&mdash;an exciting kind. Week three, here I come.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This first week at Fullstack has been filled with all kinds of fun stuff; from using GitHub to writing a program which creates Haikus (see below for my favorite Haiku so far). And though I&rsquo;ve learned a lot in the past five days, I&rsquo;d have to say that the most interesting thing I learned about was ERB for the OctoMailer project. I even had a dream about it last night! Well, at least I think I did. I don&rsquo;t remember the specifics, but I remember waking up in the middle of the night thinking, &ldquo;Whoa, Nimit said that this would happen&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve begun to realize that the most important thing for me is to make sure I ask questions. Too often I&rsquo;m weary of asking something because I don&rsquo;t want to waste the group&rsquo;s time. Also, I need to start taking more breaks, especially toward the end of the day. I find that when I get up and walk around, even for 30 seconds, my focus improves. And as for pair programming, I really liked it!</p>

<p>This week has been great, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to the next eleven.</p>
